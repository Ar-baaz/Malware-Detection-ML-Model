# Malware-Detection-ML-Model
### Demo: [Youtube]()
### Try at: [Streamlit]()
- This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) program to train Malware Detection ML Model and check if a given file is a probable MALWARE or not!
- It uses [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm for training the ML model.
- I have implemented it in 3 ways:
  - CLI app
  - Streamlit app
  - Multiserver - Client based app

## Requirements (installable via pip)
- For running CLI app:
  - joblib 
  - pefile 
- For running Streamlit app:
  - streamlit
  - joblib 
  - pefile
- For running Multiserver - Client app:
  - requests 
  - Flask 
  - joblib 
  - pefile
- For training your own model:
  - numpy 
  - pandas 
  - scikit-learn
  - joblib 
  - pefile

## What I used?
1. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
   - RandomForestClassifier
2. [Malware Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-detection/data) - The raw data here was obtained from the malware security partner of Meraz'18 - Annual Techno Cultural festival of IIT Bhilai, the said raw data constituted malware and legitimate files.
3. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - for GUI - Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.
4. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - for distributed system - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## How to run the program?
1. **Download this GitHub repository**
	- Either Clone the repository
		```
		git clone https://github.com/Kunal-Attri/Malware-Detection-ML-Model.git
		```
	- Or download and extract the zip archive of the repository.

2. **Download & Install requirements**
	- Ensure that you have Python 3 installed.
	- Open terminal in the Repository folder on your local machine.
	- Run the following command to install requirements.
		```
		pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 		```
3. **Run CLI app**
   - Get a file to check for probable malware, and run:
     ```
     python3 main.py [FILE]
     ```
4. **Run Streamlit app**
   - Try on web app [*here*]().
   - or run locally by:
     ```streamlit run streamlit_app.py```
